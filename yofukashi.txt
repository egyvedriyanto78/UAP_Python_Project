On one such walk, Kou meets a weird girl, Nazuna Nanakusa,  
who diagnoses the cause of his sleeplessness: despite making changes in his life,  
he is still holding himself back from experiencing true freedom.  
She says that he won't be able to sleep unless he is satisfied with how he spends his waking hours. 
When it appears that she has resolved his current worries, Nazuna invites him back to her apartment to share her futon.  
After a while, unaware that he is only feigning unconsciousness, she leans over himâ€”and bites his neck!
